# Progress

Last updated after end-to-end validation (position defense + full-season backtest + tune).

| Phase | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Project setup and storage | done | Config, schema, ignore files, cap, and storage report. |
| 2. Ingestion and backfill | done | nba_api, PlayByPlayV3 possessions, live-feed fallback, backfill.py. |
| 3. Injury report and overrides | done | Official PDF parse via pypdf, overrides.yaml precedence. |
| 4. Projections | done | Blend, context, absence redistribution, minutes model, zone + position defense. |
| 5. Simulation | done | Vectorized possession engine; ~5s for 10k runs. |
| 6. Outputs and daily.py | done | Summaries, results/latest JSON, prediction history, daily.py, run.py. |
| 7. Backtesting | done | Walk-forward metrics, calibration SVG, blend-parameter tuner. |
| Validation (post-backfill) | done | Position defense, single-game check, full 2024-25/2025-26 backtest, tune. |

## Phase 3

`ingest/injuries.py` downloads and parses the official NBA injury PDF in memory. `overrides.yaml` wins on status and minutes caps. Nothing is written under `DATA_DIR`.

## Phase 4

`projections/` builds per-game player rates and minutes from stored logs/rates with an `as_of` cutoff. Blend window uses configured `seasons_back` only (no longer appends every older season once the full history is present).

Opponent defense:

- Zone FG% allowed (existing `team_zone_defense` + as_of scan from rates/logs).
- **Position defense (new):** stats allowed to PG/SG/SF/PF/C from player game logs (`team_position_defense` table + as_of `position_defense_from_bundles`). Listed positions are usually G/F/C; `five_position()` maps those onto the five traditional slots using that appearance’s reb/ast.

## Phase 5

`sim/engine.py` vectorizes possessions across runs. Steals, turnovers, FTs, zone shots, blocks, assists, rebounds, pace noise, overtime.

## Phase 6

Summaries → `results/latest/*.json` and `prediction_history` (actuals filled after finals). `run.py` for single games/slates. `daily.py` for ingest → injuries → sim → storage report.

## Phase 7

- `backtest/metrics.py`: Brier (home win), MAE for PTS/REB/AST/3PM/MIN, 10th–90th coverage, calibration bins, SVG plot.
- `backtest/evaluate.py`: walk-forward over finals with prior same-season games only; caches season bundles and same-`as_of` priors/defense.
- `backtest/tune.py`: small grid over `form_decay`, `regression_strength`, and season weights; optional `--write` into `config.yaml`.

## Validation (2026-10-16)

Full history is on disk under `DATA_DIR` (2015-16 … 2025-26). Storage ~8.6 MiB, well under the 2 GB cap; storage report still prints after runs.

### 1. Position defense

Added `team_position_defense` (replace policy) and wired as_of-aware position adjustments into projections (`opponent_position_defense_weight: 0.5`).

### 2. Single-game check — 0022400061 NYK @ BOS 2024-10-22

Walk-forward as_of the game date (opening night → prior seasons only). 5000 runs, seed 42:

| | NYK | BOS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Actual | 109 | 132 |
| Sim mean | 93.8 | 95.7 |
| Home win P | — | 0.551 |

Roster is prior-season (e.g. DiVincenzo/Randle still on NYK projections; several 2024-25 rotation players under-minuted). Side-by-side player table saved under `results/validation/` (gitignored).

### 3. Walk-forward backtest — 2024-25 + 2025-26

`--runs 200 --seed 1`, 2627 games, 51365 player rows.

| Metric | Before tune | After tune |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Brier (home win) | 0.2322 | 0.2315 |
| MAE PTS | 5.75 | 5.74 |
| MAE REB | 2.52 | 2.52 |
| MAE AST | 1.85 | 1.85 |
| MAE 3PM | 0.95 | 0.95 |
| MAE MIN | 5.47 | 5.47 |
| 10th–90th coverage | 0.651 | 0.652 |

Calibration: mid bins slightly under-confident (e.g. pred ~0.45 → actual ~0.53); extremes thin. Artifacts: `results/backtest/before/`, `results/backtest/after/` (gitignored).

### 4. Tuning

Grid on early 2024-25 (`--max-games 24`). Best → `weights [0.40, 0.30, 0.20, 0.10]`, `form_decay 0.04` (written to `config.yaml`). Full-season lift was tiny; blend knobs are not the main error source.

### 5. Biggest weaknesses (fix first)

1. **Minutes / rotation model** — MAE MIN ~5.5; benches often near-zero projected minutes/usage while stars soak minutes. Opening-night and trade/roster lag make this worse. **Fix first:** better minutes prior (recent same-team appearances, role stability, explicit depth chart), and don’t zero out usage for low-minute players who are still in the rotation.
2. **Too-narrow distributions** — 10–90 coverage ~65% vs ~80% target. Widen minutes variance and possession/shot noise; consider run-level foul/blowout dispersion.
3. **Scoring level / pace** — single-game and season sims trend low on totals; revisit FT rate, three-point volume, and pace noise.
4. **Win-prob calibration** — Brier ~0.23; home favorites under-separated. Stronger team strength signal (net rating / prior margin) before possession detail.
5. **Position labels** — source logs are mostly G/F/C/None; PG–C mapping is heuristic. Improve when a better position source exists.

Storage cap and storage report remain in place.
